## Created with Capacitor Create App

This app was created using [`@capacitor/create-app`](https://github.com/ionic-team/create-capacitor-app),
and comes with a very minimal shell for building an app.

## Run the example
1. Navigate into the example folder with your cli tool
2. Execute commands `npm run build` and `npx cap sync`
3. For Android
   1. Open Android Studio and start the project on your real device
4. For iOS
   1. Adjust the iOS setup
   2. Run the project on your real device
5. Click on the "Capture image" button to start the recognizer.
6. You can play with the different configurations. Right now only the text recognizer will be active

### Notes for example iOS run
- In order to run the example without anything on your device you need to have a registered apple developer account
- Change the bundle identifier to suit your needs and unique
- Select your Team (use the same for both the App and the Pod target as well)
